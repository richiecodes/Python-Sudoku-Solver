# Python-Sudoku-Solver

## This is a starter project for me to get my feet wet into Python programming and fundamentals.


This is a simple python algorithm to solve sudokus. To use, simply edit 'main.py' board variable with the values of the puzzle you are trying to solve. The numbers are in order, left to right, top to bottom.

*Do NOT change the length of the array. If the value of the cell you're inputting is empty, put a '0' in its place instead*
